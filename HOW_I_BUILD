# How I Build

- I prefer understanding concepts from first principles.
- I implement ideas from scratch before using abstractions.
- I will try to make something constructive from the concepts i learnt.
- I value clarity and explanation over cleverness.
- I document tradeoffs and edge cases.

This repository reflects my learning process.
